# 🔬 Breast Cancer Classification

This project focuses on the classification of breast cancer using a machine learning approach. A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model was trained on the well-known `Breast Cancer Wisconsin` dataset. The model predicts whether a tumor is **malignant (cancerous)** or **benign (non-cancerous)** based on various diagnostic measurements.

A **Streamlit** interface is included, allowing users to interactively input data and view real-time predictions.
